Roster Genius takes your schedule from myPage and converts it into a nice .ics file for Calendar to use.

It is built in Python using Django, with a small bit of Javascript for the bookmarklet.

After shutting rostergeni.us down, I thought it would be best to release it's source code for others to use or run. The code isnt the best quality, nor is it the cleanest, but it's something. I don't intend on supporting or updating it much, but any pull requests are welcome.

## Getting started

To run this locally on your own computer, you'll first need a bit of setup (if you've done this before, feel free to skip) from Terminal. Copy and paste the lines without a hash, one at a time

```
# Move into your home folder
cd ~

# Create a folder called Development, and move into it
mkdir Development
cd Development

# Create a folder to contain [Python virtual envionments](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/)
mkdir venvs

# Install the [Python package manager](https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) (its like the App store for Python programming)
sudo easy_install pip

# Install [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) for sandboxing
sudo pip install virtualenv

# Create a sandbox and activate a sandbox to run roster genius within
virtualenv venvs/rostergenius
source ~/Development/venvs/rostergenius/bin/activate
```

Then download the roster genius source code and set it up.

1. Download the [GitHub Mac app](http://mac.github.com), create a GitHub account if you don't already have one, and log in.
2. Click the 'Clone in Desktop' button on the right hand side of this page, and clone it into the Development folder you created earlier.

```
# Move into the rostergenius folder you created with the GitHub app. FYI, ~ is a shortcut for your home folder
cd ~/Development/rostergenius

# Install the dependencies required by roster genius
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create the roster genius database
./manage.py syncdb
```

Assuming that completed without any errors, every time you want to start roster genius, run in Terminal:

```
# Activate the roster genius sandbox
source ~/Development/venvs/rostergenius/bin/activate

# Move into the rostergenius folder and start the server.
cd ~/Development/rostergenius
./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```


Once done, you can access roster genius at http://localhost:8000/
